=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Graphite::SNMPAgent - An SNMP agent which does non-blocking streaming of data from an SNMP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    my $agent = AnyEvent::Graphite::SNMPAgent->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => '2003',
        interval => 60,
    );

    'host' and 'port' are for the graphite server
    'interval' is how many seconds should elapse between each time we try to fire off the queries.
    If you need multiple intervals create one AE::Graphite::SNMPAgent instance per set of metrics


    $agent->add_snmp(host => $host, oid => $oid, community => $community, graphite_key => $key, filter => sub { ... });

    print "Running forever. CTRL-C to interrupt\n";
    AnyEvent->condvar->recv;
