NAME
    AnyEvent::Graphite - Non-blocking Graphite (http://graphite.wikidot.com/) client

SYNOPSIS
    The 'Graphite' tool (http://graphite.wikidot.com) is a really useful way to collect time series information.

    This module is a flexible, event-driven tool to help quickly 'bridge' Graphite with data sources that need polling (or want to asyncronously 'post' to Graphite.)

    A quick example using the included ::SNMPAgent module:

    I have a family of servers running SNMP. I want to collect load information from them.


    use AnyEvent::Graphite::SNMPAgent;

    my $agent = AnyEvent::Graphite::SNMPAgent->new(host => "graphite.mydomain.com", interval => 60);
    my @hosts = get_interesting_hosts();

    for my $host (@hosts) {
        $agent->add_snmp(
            oid => '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.10.1.5.1',
            host => $host,
            graphite_key => "servers.$host.load_1",
            filter => sub { return $_[0] * 0.01 },
        );
    }

    # run forever letting the event loop run
    AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

    Since that load_1 OID returns an integer load multiplied by 100 (i.e. load of 3.6 == 360), we need to be able to apply scaling functions.
    That's what the 'filter' callback can do, but it's optional.

    This should work for thousands of hosts and OID's, even if some of them are intermittently unresponsive.
